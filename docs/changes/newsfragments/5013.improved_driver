Fixed a bug in interlock status querying for Keithley 3706A. Originally, not all
potential responses from the system were accounted for when querying for interlock
status. A dictionary is used to map the response from the system to a string describing
the interlock status. When the system returns a response that was not accounted for, this
resulted in a KeyError being raised. Now, this dictionary accounts for all potential responses
from the system.
